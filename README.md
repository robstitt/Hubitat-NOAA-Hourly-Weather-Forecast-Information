# Hubitat-NOAA-Hourly-Weather-Forecast-Information
This app and driver ("app and related code") are based on code from a similar app/driver from Aaron Ward.

Using that as an example, I developed this app and related code solely for my own use. As such, the app, the code, the functionality, and any bug fixing is done primarily (if not exclusively) for my own benefit. However, I'm making it available as an example and/or for others to use solely at their own and complete risk in case others may find it useful. Because this is not a commercial endeavor and I am not offering this for sale nor otherwise receiving any benefit from sharing this, the harsh warranty and liability information is intended to make clear that I am unable to accept responsibility for anything that results from anyone using this app, driver, or any of the related code.

This app and related code are NOT intended to replace trusted, reliable weather alerting device (e.g., weather radios).

=========

While the original app by Aaron Ward was seemingly designed to allow "speaking" any/all weather alerts via TTS, this app is intended to return basic information from the NOAA hourly forecast.

The virtual device will have the forecast information.
